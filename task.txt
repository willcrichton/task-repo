1:  Users complain that, when they start one game, it starts the other game, as well. 
Fix the code such that each game can be played independent of one another.

2: Users complain that they don't like the black blocks in Tetris. Fix the implementation such
that the blocks are purple, yellow, green, and RED instead of black.

3: Snake currently is buggy in the way it renders the game - fix the code
such that the game renders normally 
 - Note that this includes rendering food only when the snake eats a piece of food.
- Hint: there's some code in the Tetris game that may help with this.

4: Users complain that the snake game is too fast - fix it such that the snake moves slower.
- Hint: there's some code in the Tetris game that may help with this.

5: Users want to see how many times they've played each game and what their high score is.
Implement this using the gameloader.js file.
